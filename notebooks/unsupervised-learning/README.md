# Unsupervised Learning
This section of the repository focuses on unsupervised learning methods, where no labeled target variables are 
provided. Instead, the goal is to uncover structure, patterns, or lower-dimensional representations directly from
the data.

The two primary techniques used here are:
- **[K-Means Clustering](./KMeans_Clustering.ipynb)**: a distance-based clustering algorithm
- **[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](./PCA.ipynb)**: a dimensionality reduction technique based on variance maximization
