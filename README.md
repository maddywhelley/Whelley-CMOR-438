# Whelley-CMOR-438
Github repository for CMOR 438 Data Science and Machine Learning.

This repository contains a structured collection of machine learning methods developed as part of a data science and machine learning coursework project.  
The focus is on understanding core algorithms through a combination of clean implementations, reproducible experiments, and rigorous testing.

---

## Project Overview

The repository includes:
- Implementations of selected machine learning algorithms written as reusable Python modules
- Jupyter notebooks demonstrating model behavior, training dynamics, and evaluation
- Unit tests to ensure correctness and stability of core implementations
- Automated testing via continuous integration to maintain code reliability

Algorithms are implemented either from scratch or using standard libraries where appropriate, with a consistent emphasis on interpretability and correctness.

## Learning Objectives

This project is designed to:
- Build intuition for common machine learning models and their assumptions
- Compare linear, nonlinear, and ensemble methods empirically
- Understand optimization, generalization, and model complexity
- Apply best practices in software organization, testing, and reproducibility

## Repository Structure

- `src/`  
  Core Python implementations of selected algorithms

- `notebooks/`  
  Exploratory and demonstrative notebooks organized by learning paradigm

- `tests/`  
  Unit tests written with pytest to validate model behavior

- `.github/`

## Methods Covered

Supervised learning methods include linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, perceptrons, multilayer perceptrons, support vector regression, decision trees, and ensemble models.

Unsupervised learning methods include dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques such as principal component analysis and k-means.

## Notes

This repository is intended for educational and experimental use.  
All experiments are designed to be reproducible, and the codebase prioritizes clarity and correctness over production-level optimization.
