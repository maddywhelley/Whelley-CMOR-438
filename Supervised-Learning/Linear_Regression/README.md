# Linear Regression - Predicting Tumor Cell Area


This notebook applies **Linear Regression** to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to model relationships among tumor morphology features.  
The goal is to predict **mean cell area** (`area_mean`) using measurements such as radius, perimeter, texture, and compactness.

Linear regression provides an interpretable baseline model, revealing how geometric attributes contribute to tumor area.  
The results show a strong linear relationship, with predictions closely aligning to actual values and residuals highlighting minor nonlinear effects in tumor geometry.
