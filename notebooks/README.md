# Notebooks

This directory contains all Jupyter notebooks used to demonstrate and experiment with machine learning methods implemented in this repository.  
The notebooks are organized by learning paradigm to provide a clear conceptual separation between **supervised** and **unsupervised** approaches.

Each notebook emphasizes:
- the underlying mathematical ideas,
- model implementation and training,
- visualization of results,
- and interpretation of model behavior.

## Supervised Learning Notebooks

The **supervised-learning** notebooks focus on models trained using labeled data.  
These notebooks explore both regression and classification tasks, with attention to optimization, generalization, and model complexity.

Each subdirectory contains notebooks demonstrating training, evaluation, and visualization of the corresponding model.

## Unsupervised Learning Notebooks

The **unsupervised-learning** notebooks study methods that extract structure from unlabeled data.  
These notebooks emphasize dimensionality reduction, clustering, and exploratory data analysis.

Visualizations such as cluster assignments, variance explained, and low-dimensional embeddings are used extensively to build intuition.

## Usage

To run any notebook:
1. Navigate to the desired subdirectory.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or JupyterLab.
3. Ensure required dependencies are installed.

## Dependencies

Most notebooks rely on:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Some notebooks may include additional dependencies, which are documented within the notebook itself.
