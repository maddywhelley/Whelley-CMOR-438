# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Sector Classification

This notebook implements the **KNN** algorithm to classify daily market behavior between the **Technology (XLK)** and **Energy (XLE)** ETFs based on short-term return and volatility features.  
Unlike the perceptron’s linear boundary, KNN adapts locally to the data, capturing nonlinear sector relationships.
